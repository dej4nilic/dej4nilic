👋 Hi, I’m Dejan Ilic @dej4nilic! I’m a multimedia artist and graphic designer with a PhD, passionate about creating unique visual identities. My journey in the creative field has led me to work across various mediums, from digital art to traditional design, allowing me to blend different artistic styles and techniques.

👀 I’m particularly interested in multimedia storytelling, the intersection of art and technology, and exploring how design can inspire and evoke emotions. I love working on projects that challenge conventional norms and push the boundaries of creativity across diverse artistic expressions.

🌱 Recently, I’ve been focusing on my artistic practice through various projects in Japan, New York, and other international locations. A significant highlight was my performance in Hiroshima on August 6th, commemorating the 79th anniversary of the atomic bomb, which deeply influenced my artistic perspective and engagement with contemporary themes.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative creative projects that merge technology with art, especially in the realms of game design, animation, and immersive installations. I believe that collaboration fosters creativity and leads to extraordinary outcomes.

📫 How to reach me: [dej4nilic@gmail.com] I’m always open to connecting with fellow creatives and exploring new opportunities.
